## How to use

1. Copy the code from the bookmarklet you want to use. Use the min.js version.
2. Create a new bookmark and paste the code into the address field.
3. Log into your Blinkist account and find the book you want to read.
4. Click the bookmarklet and a modal will open containing the converted text.

NOTE: If you're using Safari you'll need to enable 'Allow JavaScript from Smart Search field' in the developer settings.

The Obsidian bookmarklet is based on Kepano's [Obsidian web clipper](https://gist.github.com/kepano/90c05f162c37cf730abb8ff027987ca3). The default template is designed for use with the Dataview plugin. If you make changes, use [Bookmarklet Maker](https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/) to minify and encode the script.
